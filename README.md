# Summary


## Setup

1. Ensure you have Docker setup on your development machine.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal.

3. Run ``docker-compose up`` to build the application.

4. Navigate to ``http://localhost:5000/`` to see the application in action.

A binding is made between the container and the local development machine to enable code editing, alongside flask refreshing the server when a change is detected.
